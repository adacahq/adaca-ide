## Overview

Adaca IDE is an enterprise-first Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built as a fork of Visual Studio Code. It's designed specifically for companies that want to leverage AI for software development while maintaining strict control over their data, intellectual property, and security posture.

## Why Adaca IDE?

Modern enterprises face unique challenges when adopting AI-powered development tools:

### 🤝 **Collaboration at Scale**
- Built for large development teams with hundreds or thousands of developers
- Advanced code sharing and review workflows
- Team-wide AI model customization and knowledge sharing
- Centralized configuration management

### 🔒 **Data Security & Privacy**
- **On-premise deployment options** for complete data control
- **Data sovereignty compliance** - your code never leaves your jurisdiction
- **Zero data leakage** - AI models can be deployed within your infrastructure
- End-to-end encryption for all AI interactions
- Audit trails for all AI-assisted code generation

### 🛡️ **Intellectual Property Protection**
- Your code remains your code - no training on proprietary codebases
- Private AI models that learn from your codebase without exposing it
- Configurable IP scanning to prevent accidental exposure
- License compliance checking for AI-generated code
- AI-generated code attribution

### 🔐 **Enterprise-Grade Cybersecurity**
- SOC 2 Type II compliant architecture
- Integration with enterprise SSO providers (SAML, OIDC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for AI features
- Security scanning of AI-generated code
- Compliance with industry standards (ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR)

## Key Features

- **Private AI Models**: Deploy and use AI models within your own infrastructure
- **Hybrid Cloud Support**: Choose between on-premise, private cloud, or hybrid deployments
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Seamless integration with your existing identity providers
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Monitor and ensure compliance with your organization's policies
- **Team Analytics**: Understand how your team uses AI to improve productivity
- **Custom AI Training**: Train models on your specific codebase and coding standards
